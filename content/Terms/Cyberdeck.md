> **Bonus Access**: reflects the onboard intrusion hard ware integral to the deck. It augments the user’s base Access score, which is equal to their Intelligence modifier plus their Program skill plus this bonus Access.
> 
> **Memory**: is the number of memory units standard to the deck. Most programs and paydata files take up one unit of memory. Erasing a program from memory is an Instant action, but loading it off a program chip takes fifteen minutes to complete all its linkages.
> 
> **Shielding**: is the amount of buffer circuitry and hardwired signal damping the deck can use to lessen incoming damage to the user. Hit point losses inflicted by the Stun or Kill program Verbs deplete the deck’s Shielding before affecting the user. Shielding regenerates after fifteen minutes of calm.
>
> **CPU**: indicates the number of programs the deck can run at once. Some programs are Immediate, and self-terminate right after executing, while others are Ongoing, and take up a CPU slot until terminated as an Instant action.
