# Summary

The last great war was global and involved nuclear attacks across the world. Many of the larger nations of the past have broken down into small coalitions and city states.

This war ended several decades ago and the many cities have rebuilt and recovered.
### USA
America didn't survive the last great war. Now most of the surviving or rebuilt cities are self governing states or are part of some of the few regional governments. The [[East Coast Coalition|ECC]] to the east, [[South California]] to the west, and [[The Republic of Texas]] to the south.
### Nuke Snuffers
During the war we were able to develop a device that made conventional nuclear weapons inoperable within a large area. These devices helped stop the worst damage of the war before it could begin.

These devices are now ubiquitous with every city having them and many lone corporate Archologies also possessing them.
