Despite most of the world's nations falling apart, Texas has been able to maintain something of regional government. The republic broke off from America during the war and has maintained control over its cities, and has absorbed New Mexico and Oklahoma.

The Republic allows cities to govern themselves for the most part and only demands military service and aide from its cities to maintain itself. Acting as a central government that allows cities to create and uphold their own laws.
