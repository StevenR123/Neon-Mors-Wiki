# Summary
The Phoenix Boys are a shrewd and resourceful gang operating in the [[Phoenix Dead Zone|PDZ]], distinguished by their cunning and focus on high-stakes blackmail. They specialize in gathering damning secrets on corporate elites, government officials, and the wealthy, leveraging this information to extract money, favors, or influence. Their operations are methodical, relying on a network of spies, hackers, and informants embedded throughout [[Neo Phoenix]].

Despite their criminal dealings, the Phoenix Boys are seen as protectors by many in the [[Phoenix Dead Zone|PDZ]]. They provide food, medical supplies, and even security to struggling residents, earning a reputation as unofficial guardians in their local area. They enforce their own brand of justice, punishing those who exploit or harm their community. This dual identity as both predators and protectors makes the Phoenix Boys a paradoxical force in the chaotic streets of the [[Phoenix Dead Zone|PDZ]], respected and feared in equal measure.
