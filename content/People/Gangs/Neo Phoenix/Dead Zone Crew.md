# Summary
The Dead Zone Crew is a ruthless gang of contract killers infamous throughout [[Neo Phoenix]]. Operating from the [[Phoenix Dead Zone|PDZ]] they thrive on fear and violence. The Crew is composed of cybernetically enhanced operatives, each specializing in a form of assassination, from sniper tactics to brutal close combat.

Known for their grotesque modifications, most of their members are as much Cyber as Flesh with exposed hack jobs, making them as intimidating as they are lethal. Their calling card is unmistakable: a black sigil painted on the walls near their kills, a grim reminder of their reach and precision.
