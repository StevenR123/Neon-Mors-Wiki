# Summary
The Window Syndicate is a gang of cunning hackers and thieves operating out of the [[Phoenix Dead Zone|PDZ]], known for hacking and physical heists. They target anything with value, from stolen digital data to high-end equipment, always looking for opportunities to exploit weak points in systems or structures. Despite being a relatively small-time operation, their technical prowess has earned them occasional under-the-table contracts from corporations seeking to bypass legal constraints.

The gang's name comes from "Window," a potent street drug that heightens focus and accelerates mental processing, making it a favorite among hackers. Members are often identified by their jittery, wired demeanor and sharp reflexes, effects of their reliance on the drug. While the Syndicate lacks the resources and scale of larger gangs, their ingenuity and willingness to push boundaries make them an unpredictable force in the Dead Zoneâ€™s criminal ecosystem.
