%%
Recently made a breakthrough in miniaturizing power production. Small generator using mostly inert nuclear material that can make nearly indefinite power. Size of a loaf of bread.
Based in the [[East Coast Coalition]].

# Summary
Micro Energies is one of the five largest mega-corporations in the world and is based in the [[East Coast Coalition]]. They are focused on developing new Power Generation and Storage methods.

Micro Energies publicly has good relations with the [[East Coast Coalition|ECC]] and works with them on various projects such as the Banks Island harvesting projects.

# Projects
## Banks Island
Banks Island and the surrounding area at the far north of the continent is a resource dense area with only a single modestly sized city. It has been a great source of materials and area for experimenting with new designs for years.

Recently this has changed as there have been constant low level attacks on any projects in the area that have been making less and less viable.
## Micro Generators
In a recent press release ME has said that they have made a breakthrough in miniaturizing a generator for small scale use. The details of the breakthrough have not been released, but ME has said that it will be able to provide near indefinite amounts of power on a small scale.
