# Previous Campaign
## [[R.A.I.N.]]
Verma Corp was working with [[Atlos Industries|Atlos]] to test one of their experimental AIs Designated R.A.I.N. but a criminal group stole the prototype.

Later this Rain helped with attacks against [[Atlos Industries|Atlos]] that led to several other AIs being released into the wild.

This is the basis for the current conflict Atlos is facing across the West Coast.
