# Neon Mors Wiki

This will be the wiki to I'll be using to keep a lot of the information on my world organized and accessible to my players.

Most of the articles on here will contain basic information that anyone in the world would be able to figure out if they were looking but there will also be information on here that would not be freely available, I'll try to mark it when it wouldn't be available to everyone.

# Notes on the setting
## [[World War III]]
The last great war was global and involved nuclear attacks across the world. Many of the larger nations of the past have broken down into small coalitions and city states.

This war ended several decades ago and the many cities have rebuilt and recovered.
### USA
America didn't survive the last great war. Now most of the surviving or rebuilt cities are self governing states or are part of some of the few regional governments. The [[East Coast Coalition|ECC]] to the east, [[South California]] to the west, and [[The Republic of Texas]] to the south.
### [[Nuke Snuffers]]
During the war we were able to develop a device that made conventional nuclear weapons inoperable within a large area. These devices helped stop the worst damage of the war before it could begin.

These devices are now ubiquitous with every city having them and many lone corporate Archologies also possessing them.
## Corporate Overlords
Corporations have run rampant in the destruction most of the worlds superpowers. They are now larger and wealthier than many city-states and more often than not can work outside the law without real consequences.
