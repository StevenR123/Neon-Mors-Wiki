# Summary

Neo Phoenix is an independent city state between the ever expanding [[The Republic of Texas]] and the brewing warzone [[South California]] is turning into.

The government of Neo Phoenix is little more than a tick that sucks the life out of its citizen while taking bribes from various corps to let them do as they please. The normal citizens can make a living in most of the districts of the sprawling mega city, but no one knows real safety of privacy.

The poorest of the citizens lives outside the technical limits of the city in the half destroyed [[Phoenix Dead Zone]] along with a lot of the criminal underworld.

## City Problems
### Corrupt Leaders
The rulers of this region were even more corrupt than is usual for those in their position, trading the wealth and lives of their subjects for their own selfish purposes. They may have been so absorbed in exploiting the locals that the actual business of rule was taken over by outside parties, whether corporations, gangs, or local brotherhoods.
