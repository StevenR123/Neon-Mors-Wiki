<h1 class='centerText'>Summary</h1>

The PDZ is what remains the northern half of old Phoenix. It was heavily damaged in the the last global war and was left abandoned by the government in the decades that followed.

Now the PDZ is a lawless district full of vagrants, criminals, and corps that want to hide what they are doing. The streets aren't safe for anyone not from the PDZ as they don't know which streets belong to which gang or where the corps like to run their black ops sites.

If life in Neo Phoenix is cheap it's worth less than scrap in the PDZ.
