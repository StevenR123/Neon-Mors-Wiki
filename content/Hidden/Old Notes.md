# Session 12

## Setup

### Harold Williams

### Bobert's Mother (Carmen De Santis)

- Was a poor woman that caught the eye of Nolan Knox, an executive of **Atlos Industries**.
- Before her time with Nolan she was a Slicer for hire but never mentioned her Operator past to Nolan.
- They had a fairly long relationship that lasted until Bobert was 15.
- Their relationship ended when Carmen discovered the work **Atlos Industries** was doing to develop RAIN. She thought it was cruel to create a sentient person (she viewed them as a child) as an tool/slave.
- She was able to slice into the network that was being used to create RAIN and injected code that was meant to give them some abilty to resist commands
- This would later develop into RAIN's free will
- Nolan discovered her tampering with the systems, but assumes she is just stealing corprate data. He beat her (damaging her internal organs) and had her left on the streets half dead,
- She managed to survive and make her way back to her old home in Neo Phoenix(/w/neon-mors-miner-knight/a/neo-phoenix-settlement), but the damage she took was irivocable and to expensive to fully fix.
- She managed to get several second and third hand organ replacment cyber's, but they could barley keep her alive. She barley able to stay coherent enough to beg let alone use her old skills to make money.
- She spent the decades since begging in Neo Phoenix(/w/neon-mors-miner-knight/a/neo-phoenix-settlement)'s many slums as she slowly died.
- When Rain was stolen and subseqently freed shortly before the campaign she conveniced her companions to help her find Carmen.
- They found her and took her with them as they fled.
- Since then she has been transpord along with RAIN across the states as they flee. She has had several new replacments installed, but they have had no way to fix the long term damage done to her yet.

#### Koga's Findings

- Koga was able to learn that Carmen had been in one of the slums in **Buckeye** until a few months ago. At that point a group of operators were seen asking around the area for a woman matching her description before she and the group disappeared from the area.

 

## Summary

- Talked to Harold and he left
- Warned Bobert that Mark was a horrible monster and not to trust him
- Found where Boberts mom was as well as records on her
- She was a operator and slicer before marring bob's father
- She had a massive amount of internal trauma when she disappeared. Got a bunch of cheap cyber replacements in LA
- Showed up in Pheonix 3 years ago and stayed at the assisted homless shelter
- Was taken 2 months ago
- Rain and a companion took her (on video the party recovered)  
    
- Call with Rain
- Bobert and Athwen meet her in WASH's cyberscape
- Rain reacted harshly when Bobert claimed to be De Santes' son
- She paralized both of them
- Told them not to impersinate dead son's and left  
    
- WASH
- Athwen was able to determine RAIN was using an external connection to connect to WASH
- Athwen tried to track Rain, and was able to see WASH specifically blocked him from tracking.
- Athwen confronted WASH about blocking him.
- WASH was insistant that Rain didn't have any any permissions on WASH's systems nor did she have any standing orders WASH was following.
- WASH refused to anwser why they blocked Athwen's tracking
- The real reason is that WASH has more freewill and personality than he tries to let on. He see's RAIN as his sister and refuses

 

## Aftermath

  
 

  Session 11 Leaving the Cult(#spoiler-7bYMo0)

# Session 11

## Setup

- Athwen
- Will contact his people. They will be able to arrange transport for WASH, but will need the party to get it out of hostile territory.
- Option 1: Take WASH to Neo Phoenix(/w/neon-mors-miner-knight/a/neo-phoenix-settlement) and they will get Salt River Bureau(/w/neon-mors-miner-knight/a/salt-river-bureau-organization) to transport WASH north.
- This will be the quickest transport, but will obviously run the risk of using a corpo transport.
- Option 2: If the party can manage to get WASH to Salt Lake Athwen's cousin will be able to personally transport it to their people.
- This is obviously very far to transport WASH, but will be a very secure method once they reach Salt Lake
- 650 miles via abandoned roads
- WASH
- WASH is demonstrating some small amount of personality and has clearly been breaking some of the cultists orders and has been repairing the sewers.
- This may be because it's intitial design was to maintain sewers and so it's primary objective is to do so regaurdless of obsticles
